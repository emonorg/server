* Melissi Cloud Storage Server
** About
  Melissi is a cloud storage server written in [[http://djangoproject.org][Django]]. Is an effort to
  create a FLOSS alternative to other known proprietary cloud storage
  services, such as [[http://www.dropbox.com][Dropbox]] and [[http://one.ubuntu.com][UbuntuOne]].

  Melissi Server features a clean /API/ (written in [[https://bitbucket.org/jespern/django-piston/wiki/Home][Django Piston]]) to
  store and retrieve data. [[http://github.com/melissiproject/client/][Melissi Desktop Client]] uses this API to
  synchronize your local computer files with the server (and the so
  called "cloud"). Other applications can be developed and use melissi
  as a storage backend.

** Installing
   Melissi is /alpha/ software but you can already install your own
   instance aka /hive/ to help us test and develop more and faster.

   For installation instructions and more documentation about /melissi/
   please visit [[http://melissi-server.readthedocs.org/][our docs at readthedocs.org]]
